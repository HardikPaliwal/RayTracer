commands to run:
premake4 gmake
make config=release
cp A4 Assets/.
./A4 test.lua

For this project I have completed objective 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. I have attempted 10, and 1. 

test[0-7].lua are proof of the objectives working.

My attempt on 10 is in the Mesh.h, Mesh.c file.

I have modified A4_render to also take in samples for anti aliasing, threads for multi threading and samples 
for path tracing (path tracing does not work).

I have also modified materials to take in texture, bump mapping images. 

Lastly I modifed meshes to add a variable to enable interpolated vertex normals or face normals for shading.

For proof of multithreading working, run test0.lua with 1 thread vs 4 threads (by default it runs with 4 threads)

With 1 thread I get a runtime of: 28s
with 4 threads I get: 8sec
To modify number of threads, change second last variable in g2.render in the .lua file.
