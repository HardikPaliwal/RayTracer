For this assignment I have attempted to complete everything. My extra feature is reflections. My sample scene is a reflective plane and reflective dodeca with 3 light sources. The scene was implemented in a hierarchal manner. 
I also enabled reflectance for nonheir.lua scene in order to make it  a bit easier to mark. 

 However some issues remain.

 1. Something is wrong with cubes. They appear heavily noised. Apart from that they work fine (all transformations work and everything)

 2. my hierarchal model  works more or less but it is a bit buggy. For example hier.lua comes out fine but simple-cow.lua has the first space faring cow and is beyond the reach of my ray tracer


Per the objectives list I am not meeting 2 of them:

2. â–¢ Cubes and triangle meshes are properly rendered.

5. Hierarchical transformations perform correctly. Spheres and cubes can be transformed via arbitrary Affine transformations.

But both objectives are more than partially implemented- save for some stupid bug they are pretty much finished. Please take that into consideration when marking (and also the fact that I forgot to submit my README for A3 and thus lost 10% for no reason. I assure you that README was as awesome as this one is.)


Lastly note that in order to make an item be considered reflective by my program, just set the m_shininess value to 6.666.  Yes this is a hardcoded, magic number. 
In my defense I am writing this at 9am after an all nighter trying to fix the aforementioned bugs which did not work out well.
